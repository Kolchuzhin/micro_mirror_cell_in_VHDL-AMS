System Level Model of micromirror cell in VHDL-AMS generated by ANSYS ROM Tool
==============================================================================


The goal of this project is to popularize of Mode Superposition based Reduced Order Modeling technique for MEMS simulations.


Simplorer model:
----------------


Simulink Model:
---------------

  Simulink model of the micromirror cell.

Geometric model:
----------------

  The CAD geometry of the micromiror cell in an IGES format.

hAMSter model:
--------------

  "Original Model" with comments + testbench.vhd;
  The vhd-files have been compiled with hAMSter simulator.

Original Model:
